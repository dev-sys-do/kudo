# Command Line Interface - convention

## Command emphasis

The following typefaces are used to show command emphasis:

**boldface**
    Text in **boldface** represents command names.

**italics**
    Text in *italics* is used for variables for which you supply actual values, such as a default directory or the name of a cluster.

**monospace**
    Text in `monospace` identifies the data or commands that you type, samples of command output, examples of program code or messages from the system, or names of command flags, parameters, arguments, and name-value pairs.

## Special characters

The following special characters are used in the command descriptions:

**minus sign (-)**
    Flags are prefixed with a minus sign (-). Flags define the action of a command or modify the operation of a command. You can use multiple flags, followed by parameters, when you issue a command. This character cannot be used as the first character of an object name. Use one minus sign before one-letter flags / short flags and two min signs before a long flag.

**vertical bar ( | )**
    A vertical bar signifies that you choose only one value.
    For example, [ a | b ] indicates that you can choose a, b, or nothing. Similarly, { a | b } indicates that you must choose either a or b.

**quotation marks (" ")**
    Quotation marks around a string indicate that the value can include spaces, for example, "my session name."

**brackets ([ ])**
    Brackets indicate optional options, parameters, and arguments.
**braces ({ })**
    Braces indicate a required choice between two or more options or arguments.
**ellipsis (...)**
    Ellipses indicate repetition or multiple values or arguments.
